# Related uses a set of patterns to populate a list of files related     #
# to the one you're currently in. There are two components of a pattern: #
# the matcher and the results.                                           #
#                                                                        #
# The matcher is a regular expression. You can use capture groups and    #
# refer to them in your results. The matcher is given the path of the    #
# current file, relative to the top-level directory. For instance, a     #
# file located at /Users/foo/bar/test.txt, with the foo directory opened #
# in the editor, would use the filename 'bar/test.txt' when comparing    #
# with the matcher.                                                      #
#                                                                        #
# The results are list of files that will be searched whenever the       #
# current file matches the matcher. You can refer to the capture groups  #
# using $n (e.g., $1, $2, etc). You may also use glob patterns in your   #
# results                                                                #
